* environment setup: Docker built from go
* run using

docker run -it -v `pwd`:/go/src/github/cdupree/time-api -w /go/src/github/cdupree/time-api -p 8000 go

so now we can develop locally (ie, outside the image)

* develop main.go stub, and we can run now curl fro outside the image, but
  we get a 404 with

  /datetime

  because we have not yet written the code for that endpoint, or registered
  it. (commit: c7fbf70d6a788c6ad1b2a32dcc7594e2c8c52ad0)

* add stub for datetime getter 

74094025922cdb08ac4c28243b4a788c03f3a50e

Now we at leat get 200 OK as a return code, but an empty body.

So now it's time to flesh out the server.

* add imoprt to get the time object. This has both the current UTC (since
  container is using UTC as /etc/timezone) time, and also a timer which 
  monotonically increases from the moment that that the program begins. 
  This will be useful for the client, too.
